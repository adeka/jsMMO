Universal Sprite Sheet
======================

An attempt to consolidate all of the humanoid entries from the Liberated Pixel Cup, lpc.opengameart.org, into a single GIMP project, as well as to try and make most clothing accessible by either gender.

Updates By JaidynReiman
==============
This version of the Universal Sprite Sheet consists of me, JaidynReiman (@jrconway3) making additional updates and touchups to the universal sprite sheet. @makrohn hasn't had much of a reason to update much recently and seems content with me making some updates and changes. I'm currently working on my own RPG game and I'm using LPC sprites to complete my characters and designs.

I will only create new alterrations when I need them, but I will also attempt to finish a number of bugs in the existing sheets I have found as I continue working on my sprites. @makrohn has now started to incorporate my updates into the original as well, so I'm going to work on keeping my commits cleaner from now on.

I will be slowly working on it, so note that it won't get touched up right away. In my first game planned I have more main female characters than male, so male sprite fixes will likely lag behind for a while until I can get to my male characters, so be patient while I work on them.

Abbreviations
=============

In trying to keep things organized, I've employed a few different abbreviations to keep the filenames from running out of control.  They are:
 - sc: spellcast
 - th: thrust
 - wc: walkcycle
 - sl: slash
 - sh: shoot
 - hu: hurt

Collaborating
=============

If you'd like to help out, please do so!  I've worked with @joewhite to hammer out some basic guidelines:
 - Edit the .png files, not the .xcf.  Once the pull is merged, a maintainer (@makrohn) will fold the .png files into the .xcf
 - As with code, try to keep pull requests grouped thematically - eg, "skintonefixes" "suitandtie" "blackshoes" so they can be evaluated separately.
